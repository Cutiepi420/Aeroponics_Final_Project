# Aeroponics_Final_Project

This repository contains the source code to interface with the hardware of an aeroponics system. This is our final project for Rice University's Microcontrollers 421/521 taught by Dr. Jordan Miller.


##Brainstorm 

Working Air with the Utilization of Microcontrollers
David Yalacki & Allie Porter

Aeroponics is derived from the Latin words, aero (air) and ponos (work).1 The concept of aeroponics is that the root zone of a plant is suspended in air and is misted with a nutrient solution to promote faster plant growth. Aeroponics is a system proven to more efficiently deliver oxygen to the roots, while using 95% less water compared to conventional gardening.1 Our design will borrow from online documentation on DIY aeroponic systems but will significantly improve upon available systems by introducing feedback control to create a system that optimizes growing conditions based on the type of plant. Microcontrollers will be employed to control the water distribution and obtain data on temperature, light intensity and humidity.  Eventually, we hope that our device can respond to environmental conditions as well (e.g. if plants are sitting by a window sill, pull weather data, and use this information to inform the water distribution control system if more/less water is needed.) To do this, our team expects to need: a high-pressure water pump, pre-pressurized accumulator tank, electrical-solenoid hooked to a relay timer, a pressure switch, and mister nozzle.1 We will first attempt to control the mister nozzle. We will continue by automating this process and conclude by allowing weather data to modify the amount of water sprayed and length of time water is sprayed.

##Abstract

Working Air with the Utilization of Microcontrollers
David Yalacki & Allie Porter


Aeroponics is derived from the Latin words, aero (air) and ponos (work).1 The concept of aeroponics is that the root zone of a plant is suspended in air and is misted with a nutrient solution to promote faster plant growth. Aeroponics is a system proven to more efficiently deliver oxygen to the roots, while using 95% less water compared to conventional gardening.1 Our design will borrow from online documentation on DIY aeroponic systems, but will significantly improve upon available systems by introducing feedback control to create a system that optimizes growing conditions based on climate. Microcontrollers will be employed to alter the water distribution and obtain data on temperature, light intensity, and humidity.  Eventually, we hope that our device can respond to our recorded environmental conditions as well (e.g. if plants are sitting by a window sill, pull weather data, and use this information to inform the water distribution control system if more/less water is needed.) To begin this, our team expects to need: a high-pressure water pump, pre-pressurized accumulator tank, electrical-solenoid hooked to a relay timer, a pressure switch, and mister nozzle.1  We will first attempt to control the mister nozzle. Then, our team will focus on monitoring and recording data on temperature, humidity, and light. We will continue by automating this process and conclude by allowing weather data to modify the amount of water sprayed and length of time water is sprayed on the roots.
