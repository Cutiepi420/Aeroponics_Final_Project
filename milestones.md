#Working Air with the Utilization of Microcontrollers
##David Yalacki & Allie Porter
##Microcontrollers 420- Final Project

##Milestones

1. October 20th: Upload current status of project and begin work on code.
Accomplished: Uploading readme and brainstorming documents. Begin initial coding steps.

2. October 27th: Order all hardware parts and have a coding outline for proof of concept design. Begin Troubleshooting.
Accomplished: Work on setting up touch screen, edit code, order additional parts, begin working on hardware set up (we only having a few of the parts)
3. November 3rd: Abstract Due. Finish troubleshooting for proof of concept design and discuss the final addition of additional features. Our device should output water based on our code. We should be able to control our device and water output.
Accomplished: Addition of temperature and humidity sensor. Able to actively monitor this data (with low accuracy, high reliability). Gained control of the solenoid valve. Ready to attach tubing and add in the pump to properly output water 

4. November 10th: Protoype Due. Ensure our device is functioning and output water as designated by our code.
5. November 17th: Fit & Finish. Add on any additional features that can improve upon our design without compromising its function.
6. November 29th: Submit all code. Ensure that our device is functional and either takes in data or reads it from a sensor.
7. December 1st: Final Presentation. Create a video or powerpoint presentation to show the functionality of our device.
